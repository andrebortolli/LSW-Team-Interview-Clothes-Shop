  speechText: 'The Wise Sir Bedevere Was The First To Join King Arthur''s Knights,
    But Other Illustrious Names Were Soon To Follow: Sir Lancelot The Brave, Sir
    Gallahad The Pure, And Sir Robin The-Not-Quite-So-Brave-As-Sir-Lancelot, Who
    Had Nearly Fought The Dragon Of Angnor, Who Had Nearly Stood Up To The Vicious
    Chicken Of Bristol, And Who Had Personally Wet Himself At The Battle Of Badon
    Hill, And The Aptly Named Sir Not-Appearing-In-This-Film. Together They Formed
    A Band Whose Names And Deeds Were To Be Retold Throughout The Centuries: The
    Knights of the Round Table.'
