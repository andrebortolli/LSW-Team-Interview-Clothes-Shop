    Here, All There Was Was Swamp. Other Kings Said I Was Daft To Build A Castle
    On A Swamp, But I Built It All The Same, Just To Show ''Em. It Sank Into The
    Swamp. So, I Built A Second One. That Sank Into The Swamp. So, I Built A Third
    One. That Burned Down, Fell Over, Then Sank Into The Swamp, But The Fourth One...
    Stayed Up! And That''s What You''re Gonna Get, Lad: the strongest castle in these
    islands.'
